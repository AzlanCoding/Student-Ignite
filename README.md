# Student Ignite!
Corruption of youths through Social Media

Recently, in the news, there has been a lot of cases of youths getting self-radicalised from any forms of social media. From game services to the basic YouTube. There are also a lot of news about the concern towards the mental health of Youths and also higher suucide rates. There are also a lot of suicide rates caused by social media. However, it is not possible to cut off youths to the social network completely. Thus, I'm working on a project called Student Ignite. A social platform for Youths to share their hobbies in a safe environment with students only. Equipped with Nudity filter, vulgarity filter and cyberbullying detection(planned) to protect students in their constantly evolving social media. Moreover, it will solve other problems that students face in school such as project/homework management, A Better Device Manager Application (With Proxy Filter) and a Fusion editor(planned) to create awesome media content such as videos, music and many more.
Now for games, Ignite will have it's own "play store" where students interested in programming can release apps and games for other students to play with as long as the game/app is suitable for youths.
