# Student Ignite!
The project Student Ignite founded by AzlanCoding is to combat the arguement with Students and Mobile Guardian. Students really hated Mobile guardian as it was buggy and did not give students a lot of leeway. It cause a lot of frustration amongst students in Singapore(MOE). Moreover, Students felt like they laked good software to open pptx and docx files as teachers used PowerPoint and Word (rarely Excel) and send them to students. When students receive these doccuments they are forced to use Kami(For Hai Sing Catholic) to convert office doccuments to PDF. This makes it untidy for students and teachers creating more frustration. Thus, the project Student Ignite aims to help make a conducive learnig environment for students not just through studying, but through Social Media, Games and a Points System to encourage Students to do better in their studies. It's an all in one application that comes with a Browser(Ignite Broweser) and a Proxy(Sinktrap) and a all in one doccument reader(Inferno) powered by either Aspose or open office(still deciding). It also includes a app store(TBC) and a point system (embeded in the whole system)
