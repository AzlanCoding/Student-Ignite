To free up the server, the videos will be stored in the user's Google Drive. This will also allow the user to delete the video anytime. When prompted, it will upload to an application folder called `Ignite Storage/Student Connect` and the name will be the title of the video. See https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/appdata#python
Once uploaded, the file can be streamed instantly through the url `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=` + the google drive file id.
